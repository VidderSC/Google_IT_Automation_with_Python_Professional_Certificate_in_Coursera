- Deleting branches:

We can delete a branch that we don't need anymore by using the "-d" flag
when calling the "git branch" command.

$ git branch -d new-test-branch 
Deleted branch new-test-branch (was 95fd3fe).

$ git branch
* main
  test-branch

If there are changes in the branch we want to delete that haven't been merged
back into the master branch, git will let us know with an error.
