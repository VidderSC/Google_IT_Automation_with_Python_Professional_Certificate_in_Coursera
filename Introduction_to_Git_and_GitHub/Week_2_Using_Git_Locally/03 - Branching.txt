- What is a branch?
At it's most basic level, a branch is a pointer to a particular commit.
But more importantly, it represents an independent line of development
in a project. Of which the commit it points to is the latest link in a
chain of developing history.

When creating a new Git repository, the default name for our main branch
is MASTER. 
* Personal note: 
This is subject to change and recommended to change it to a different
name, for example: MAIN.


- Creating new branches.

We can use the "git branch" comand to list, create, delete and
manipulate branches in our repository.

Using "git branch" on it's own will list all the branches:
* main

adding the name of a branch after "git branch" will create a new branch:

$ git branch test-branch

$ git branch
* main
  test-branch

For us to change to a different branch, we use the "git checkout" command.
We use git checkout to check out the latest snapshot for both files and
for branches.

$ git checkout
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

$ git checkout test-branch 
Switched to branch 'test-branch'

$ git branch
  main
* test-branch


Creating a branch and switching to it immediately is so common that Git give us
a useful shortcut to create a new branch and switch to it in a single command.
This shortcut is by using the "-b" flag when calling the checkout command.

$ git checkout -b new-test-branch
Switched to a new branch 'new-test-branch'

$ git branch
  main
* new-test-branch
  test-branch
