Exercise - 1

We'll be working with a log file named syslog.log, which contains logs 
related to ticky.

You can view this file using:
cat syslog.log

The log lines follow a pattern similar to the ones we've seen before.
Something like this:

May 27 11:45:40 ubuntu.local ticky: INFO: Created ticket [#1234] (username)
Jun 1 11:06:48 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR: Connection to DB failed (username)

- When the service runs correctly, it logs an INFO message to syslog.
It then states what it did and states the username and ticket number related
to the event.

- If the service encounters a problem, it logs an ERROR message to syslog.
This error message indicates what was wrong and states the username that
triggered the action that caused the problem.

In this section, we'll search and view different types of error messages.
The error messages for ticky details the problems with the file with a
timestamp for when each problem occurred.

These are a few kinds of listed error:
- Timeout while retrieving information
- The ticket was modified while updating
- Connection to DB failed
- Tried to add information to a closed ticket
- Permission denied while closing ticket
- Ticket doesn't exist

To grep all the logs from ticky, use the following command:

grep ticky syslog.log

Output:
Jan 31 00:09:39 ubuntu.local ticky: INFO Created ticket [#4217] (mdouglas)
Jan 31 00:16:25 ubuntu.local ticky: INFO Closed ticket [#1754] (noel)
Jan 31 00:21:30 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR The ticket was modified while updating (breee)
Jan 31 00:44:34 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Permission denied while closing ticket (ac)
Jan 31 01:00:50 ubuntu.local ticky: INFO Commented on ticket [#4709] (blossom)
Jan 31 01:29:16 ubuntu.local ticky: INFO Commented on ticket [#6518] (rr.robinson)
Jan 31 01:33:12 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (mcintosh)
Jan 31 01:43:10 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (jackowens)
Jan 31 01:49:29 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (mdouglas)
Jan 31 02:30:04 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Timeout while retrieving information (oren)


In order to search all the ERROR logs, use the following command:

grep "ERROR" syslog.log

Output:
Jan 31 00:21:30 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR The ticket was modified while updating (breee)
Jan 31 00:44:34 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Permission denied while closing ticket (ac)
Jan 31 01:33:12 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (mcintosh)
Jan 31 01:43:10 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (jackowens)
Jan 31 01:49:29 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (mdouglas)
Jan 31 02:30:04 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Timeout while retrieving information (oren)
Jan 31 02:55:31 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Ticket doesn't exist (xlg)
Jan 31 03:05:35 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Timeout while retrieving information (ahmed.miller)
Jan 31 03:08:55 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Ticket doesn't exist (blossom)
Jan 31 03:39:27 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR The ticket was modified while updating (bpacheco)


To enlist all the ERROR messages of specific kind use the below syntax.

Syntax: grep ERROR [message] [file-name]

grep "ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket" syslog.log

Output:
Jan 31 01:33:12 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (mcintosh)
Jan 31 01:43:10 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (jackowens)
Jan 31 01:49:29 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (mdouglas)
Jan 31 04:31:49 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (oren)
Jan 31 05:12:39 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (oren)
Jan 31 05:18:45 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (sri)
Jan 31 08:01:40 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (jackowens)
Jan 31 09:04:27 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (noel)
Jan 31 11:04:02 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (breee)
Jan 31 11:58:33 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (ahmed.miller)
Jan 31 12:58:16 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (nonummy)
Jan 31 14:56:35 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR Tried to add information to closed ticket (noel)


Let's now write a few regular expressions using a python3 interpreter.

We can also grep the ERROR/INFO messages in a pythonic way using a regular expression.
Let's now write a few regular expressions using a python3 interpreter.

Open Python shell using the command below:

python3

This opens a Shell, which is used to execute a single Python command and get the result.

Import the regular expression module (re).

import re
line = "May 27 11:45:40 ubuntu.local ticky: INFO: Created ticket [#1234] (username)"

To match a string stored in line variable, we use the search() method by defining a pattern.

re.search(r"ticky: INFO: ([\w ]*) ", line)

Output:
<re.Match object; span=(29, 57), match='ticky: INFO: Created ticket '>

You can also get the ERROR message as we did for the INFO log above from the ERROR log line.

line = "May 27 11:45:40 ubuntu.local ticky: ERROR: Error creating ticket [#1234] (username)"

To match a string stored in a line variable, we use the search() method by defining a pattern.

re.search(r"ticky: ERROR: ([\w ]*) ", line)

Output:
<re.Match object; span=(29, 65), match='ticky: ERROR: Error creating ticket '>

Now that you know how to use regular expressions with Python, start fetching logs of ticky
for a specific username. We'll need them in later sections.
