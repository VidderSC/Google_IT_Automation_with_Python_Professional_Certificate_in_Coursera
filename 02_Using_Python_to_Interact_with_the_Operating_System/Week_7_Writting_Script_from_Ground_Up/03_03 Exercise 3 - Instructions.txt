Exercise - 3

We'll now work with a file named csv_to_html.py.
This file converts the data in a CSV file into an HTML file that contains
a table with the data. Let's practice this with an example file.

Create a new CSV file.

nano user_emails.csv

Add the following data into the file:
Full Name, Email Address
Blossom Gill, blossom@abc.edu
Hayes Delgado, nonummy@utnisia.com
Petra Jones, ac@abc.edu
Oleg Noel, noel@liberomauris.ca
Ahmed Miller, ahmed.miller@nequenonquam.co.uk
Macaulay Douglas, mdouglas@abc.edu
Aurora Grant, enim.non@abc.edu
Madison Mcintosh, mcintosh@nisiaenean.net
Montana Powell, montanap@semmagna.org
Rogan Robinson, rr.robinson@abc.edu
Simon Rivera, sri@abc.edu
Benedict Pacheco, bpacheco@abc.edu
Maisie Hendrix, mai.hendrix@abc.edu
Xaviera Gould, xlg@utnisia.net
Oren Rollins, oren@semmagna.com
Flavia Santiago, flavia@utnisia.net
Jackson Owens, jackowens@abc.edu
Britanni Humphrey, britanni@ut.net
Kirk Nixon, kirknixon@abc.edu
Bree Campbell, breee@utnisia.net


Save the file by clicking Ctrl-o, Enter key, and Ctrl-x.

Give executable permission to the script file csv_to_html.py.

sudo chmod +x csv_to_html.py


To visualize the data in the user_emails.csv file, you have to generate a
webpage that'll be served by the webserver running on the machine.

The script csv_to_html.py takes in two arguments, the CSV file, and location
that would host the HTML page generated.
Give write permission to the directory that would host that HTML page:

sudo chmod  o+w /var/www/html


Next, run the script csv_to_html.py script by passing two arguments:
user_emails.csv file and the path /var/www/html/.
Also, append a name to the path with an HTML extension.
This should be the name that you want the HTML file to be created with.

./csv_to_html.py user_emails.csv /var/www/html/<html-filename>.html

Replace <html-filename> with the new name.


Navigate to the /var/www/html directory. Here, you'll find an HTML file
created with the filename you passed to the above script.

ls /var/www/html


Now, to view this HTML page, open any web-browser and enter the following
URL in the search bar.

[linux-instance-external-IP]/[html-filename].html

Output:


You should now be able to visualize the data within the user_emails.csv file
on a webpage.
