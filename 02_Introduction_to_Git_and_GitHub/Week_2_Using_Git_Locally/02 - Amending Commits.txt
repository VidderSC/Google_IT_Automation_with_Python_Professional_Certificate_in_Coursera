Amending Commits

If we have already commited some changes but, we realize that we need to remove 
some files or change the commit comment, we can use the "--amend" flag on the
"git commit" command:

git commit --amend

When we run "git commit --amend", git will take whatever is currently in our
staging area and run the git commit workflow to overwrite the previous commit.

While using this "--amend" flag is ok to do on our personal git repositories,
we should not use it on public commits. 

This is because using "--amend" rewrites the git history removing the previous
commit and replacing it with the amended one.
This can lead to some confusing situations when working with other people and
should definitely be avoided.

*** Avoid ammending commits that have already been made public. ***
