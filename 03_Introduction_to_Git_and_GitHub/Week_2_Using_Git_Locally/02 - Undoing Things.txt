Revert modifications

- Before Stagin our changes:

If we modify a file that is being tracked, and we check that our modifications 
didn't have the expected result and/or is not working, without stagin the file,
we can run the "git status" command and see the list of all the modified files,
then we can use the following command to discard the changes on the working
directory made to that file:

git checkout <filename>

If we need to check out individual changes instead of the whole file, we can do
that by using the "-p" flag. This will ask you change by change if you want to 
go back to the previous snapshot or not.


- Once we have staged them but not commited yet:

To revert changes made to a file that we have already staged, we can run the 
"git reset" command, also can be seen on the "git status" screen.

git reset HEAD <filename>
