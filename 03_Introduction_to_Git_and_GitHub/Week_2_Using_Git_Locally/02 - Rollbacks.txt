Rollbacks

Public commits can be reverted in a couple of different ways, one of them is by
using the following command:

git revert HEAD

Git revert doesn't just mean undo.
Instead, it creates a commit that contains the inverse of all the changes made
in the bad commit in order to cancel them out.
This way we will undo the changes without touching the commits history.
