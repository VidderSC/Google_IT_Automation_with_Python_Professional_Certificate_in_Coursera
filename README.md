### Notes:
**_You will NOT receive a certificate if you follow this course on my GitHub repo._**

The files that you will find here are just from saving my progress, and files that I will be creating while following the paid course in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation). :man_technologist:

> [!NOTE]
> These files are not required to be created and I'm just doing it so I have them recorded somewhere. :file_cabinet:

You are welcome to check the files if you like. Mostly all of them are a transcript from the videos in the course. Also, I've tried to include as many example files as possible, writting the code seen on the video into files.

Happy Coding! :tada:
