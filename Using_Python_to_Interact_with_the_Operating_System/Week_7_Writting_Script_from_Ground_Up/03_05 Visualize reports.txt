Visualize reports

First, give executable permission to the Python script ticky_check.py.

chmod +x ticky_check.py


Run the ticky_check.py by using the following command:

./ticky_check.py


Executing ticky_check.py will generate two report file 
    - error_message.csv 
    - user_statistics.csv.

You can now visualize the "error_message.csv" and "user_statistics.csv" by
converting them to HTML pages. 

To do this, pass the files one by one to the script csv_to_html.py file, 
like we did in the previous section.

To convert the error_message.csv into HTML file run the following command:

./csv_to_html.py error_message.csv /var/www/html/<html-filename>.html

Replace <html-filename> with the name of your choice.


To convert user_statistics.csv into HTML file, run the following command:

./csv_to_html.py user_statistics.csv /var/www/html/<html-filename>.html

Replace <html-filename> with the new name


Now, to view these HTML pages, open any web-browser and enter the following
URL in the search bar.

[linux-instance-external-IP]/[html-filename].html



Congratulations!
You've successfully written some automation scripts that process the
system log and generate a bunch of reports based on the information
extracted from the log files. 

You have also hosted these reports on a webpage.
As an IT specialist, this will help you to work with Python scripting
to generate HTML tabular data for data visualization.
