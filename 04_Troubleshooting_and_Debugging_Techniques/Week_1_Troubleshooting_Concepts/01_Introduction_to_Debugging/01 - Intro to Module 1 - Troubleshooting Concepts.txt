Whether it's an application crashing, a hardware issue, or network outage, as 
IT specialists, we tend to run into problems that need solving pretty 
regularly. 

When facing these issues, we need to make sure that people affected by the 
problem can get back to doing their jobs as fast as possible. 

We also have to plan for how to prevent against the same problems from 
happening again in the future. 

In this module, we'll learn some essential debugging techniques. 
We'll start with the basic process that we can use for tackling any technical 
problem. 
Then we'll look at different ways that we can approach understanding what's 
going on and finding the root cause of an issue, including using a process 
called binary search to troubleshoot problems. 

Along the way, we'll talk about a bunch of examples of real-world problems and 
how to apply the techniques to solve them.

The techniques we'll look at are reusable and we'll let you solve almost any 
technical problem that you might face in the future. We'll keep applying them 
throughout the course as we explore different issues that can affect us or the 
users we're supporting in different ways. 

Finding the solution to a problem can sometimes take a really long time. 
Dealing with software is like trying to solve one giant puzzle.
