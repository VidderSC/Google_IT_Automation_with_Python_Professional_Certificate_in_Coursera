Postmortem: External network down
Date: 2020-01-06


- Executive Summary

Impact: The network connection was down and nobody could access the internet 
        for 2 hours.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in our main router caused all traffic to be sent
            to a void.
Action Items: The bad configuration was rolled back. Improved testing to avoid
              this in the future is being developed.


- Root Causes and Trigger

With change #275643, we intended to deploy traffic shaping to our router. However, there was a typo in the rules that caused the router to error out with syntax error and deny all traffic instead.

The change was created in advance and put into the release pipeline. This meant that there was a significant delay between the commit and the outage, causing some confusion as to why it had happened.

When the outage happened, it took a while to understand what was going on, because we had no internet access to help us figure it out.


- Lessons Learned

Things that went well:
    · Our monitoring detected the problem really quickly
    · Once we understood the problem, we were able to roll back to the previous 
      known version.
