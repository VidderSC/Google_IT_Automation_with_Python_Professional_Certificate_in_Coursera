IT skills in action reading

Congratulations! You have gained so much knowledge on automating real-world 
tasks with Python. 

There are many technical pieces that are included within automating specific 
tasks, but how would you apply the skills you’ve learned in a professional 
setting?

In this reading, you will review an example of how calling APIs and handling 
exceptions are used in the real world.

Disclaimer: The following scenario is based on fictitious companies.


- An outdated customer support system:

Adam Reyes, a software engineer, had a vast amount of data stored in the 
customer support system, SupportGenius Solutions. 
SupportGenius Solutions was the original customer support system on the market. 
At the time, they were innovative and created a huge disruption in the software 
industry. Unfortunately, SupportGenius Solutions is still using technology that 
isn’t fully supported and lacks the scalability that other systems have. 
Because of this, Adam knew it was time to shop for a new customer support 
system.


- Migrating data:

Adam did some research and decided to go with a new customer support system 
called SupportWave Technologies. 
SupportWave Technologies is up to date and able to handle Adam’s growing 
customer service demands. Adam needed to migrate his data from SupportGenius 
Solutions to SupportWave Technologies, but the only way to do this was to pay 
for a service to transfer the data. This solution was perfectly fine with Adam 
until he realized this transferring service was going to cost him thousands of 
dollars. There had to be another — cheaper — way.


- The affordable solution:

Adam decided to use his Python programming skills to migrate the data instead. 
He called APIs and the requests module to extract the data from SupportGenius 
Solutions and processed everything on his own. 
Then, he loaded the data onto SupportWave Technologies. One downside to 
SupportWave Technologies that Adam discovered was that its API was prone to 
random errors. Adam decided to use Python’s exception handling mechanism to 
retry operations until they were completed. Adam used his Python skills to not 
only migrate data from one customer support system to another,  and he also did 
it affordably, allowing him to handle the growing customer service inquiries he 
was receiving.
