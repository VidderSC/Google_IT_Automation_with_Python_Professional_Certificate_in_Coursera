SLAs

The words I promise are powerful and meaningful. If you tell someone you 
promise to do something, that person is expecting you to follow through with 
your promise.
In the operations and tech world, these promises are called service-level 
agreements (SLAs).

In this reading, you will learn more about SLAs, how they relate to 
service-level objectives (SLOs), and common SLAs in the industry.


- Service-level agreements:

A service-level agreement is an agreement between a vendor and its clients or 
users that can be legally binding. 

Typically the SLA is included in the sale contract, guaranteeing a minimum 
level of performance for the client’s or user’s application. You can think of 
these as promises you are giving your users. And as with any promise there are 
consequences for breaking that promise.

The SLA writes out the consequences that result if the promises are not met. 
Metrics in the SLA can include uptime, responsiveness, and responsibilities. 


- How SLAs relate to SLOs:

An SLA outlines the specific SLOs and the penalties for violating them. 
Oftentimes, these consequences are a financial penalty or a cancellation of the 
contract. Because of this, it is important to understand what SLAs have been 
agreed upon to make informed decisions about how much to invest in reliability.

- Key takeaways:

An SLA is a service agreement typically between an IT service provider and a 
client. It outlines the details of the service, including what the service 
should accomplish and the consequences if there is a breach in the contract.
