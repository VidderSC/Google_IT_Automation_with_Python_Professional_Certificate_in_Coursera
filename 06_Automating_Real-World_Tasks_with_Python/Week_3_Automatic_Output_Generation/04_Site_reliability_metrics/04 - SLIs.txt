SLIs

A common term used by DevOps engineers and software developers is service-level 
indicator (SLI). SLIs measure the performance of an application at any given 
time.

In this reading, you will learn more about SLIs, including what they are, how 
to measure and monitor them, and how they relate to service-level agreements 
(SLAs) and service-level objectives (SLOs).


- Service-level indicators:

An SLI measures the performance of your application against the objective, or 
SLO. It’s important to monitor SLIs to determine if your application is meeting 
the objective — or violating the SLA. 
Simply, SLIs help answer the question, “How did we do?” in terms of having a 
promise and reaching that promise. Remember to keep your SLIs simple and choose 
the right metrics to track. 


- SLI example:

Imagine that you work for an IT company and enter into a contract with 
customers. The contract contains the following SLA:
"""
You will maintain 99% uptime of your application, defined as “the home page loads correctly 99% of the time within 10 seconds or less.”
"""

The SLA tells you which SLIs you should monitor, including the page load time 
and whether the page loads correctly or returns an HTTP error message.

Monitoring tools like "DataDog" or "AppDynamics" can measure and record these 
metrics for you. These tools offer the ability to perform synthetic checks, by 
simulating a user accessing your application, and recording the results. 

The results from the synthetics checks can be used as your SLIs. These 
monitoring tools help you determine if you are staying within your SLOs.


- Key takeaways:

Service-level indicators help make service-learning objectives measurable.
They provide actual data on performance. 
SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs all play a role in the overall service reliability.
