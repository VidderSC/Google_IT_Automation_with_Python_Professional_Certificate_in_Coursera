What is Flask?

Flask is a Python library that makes it easier to create web applications and 
REST (Representational State Transfer) web services. Flask is a microframework 
that does not use an object relational manager (ORM). It is designed to be 
simple, providing the essentials for building web applications without imposing 
too many constraints or requiring a lot of boilerplate code. 

- Why use Flask?
Developers have the freedom to select their favorite design pattern, database, 
plugins, and other features using Flask.

Flask is great for rapid development, as most features are optional and can be 
brought in when you need them. Supporting WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) 
templates enable scalability and flexibility.

Flask supports building REST API servers and microservices. Flask allows 
developers to focus on creating the specific endpoints and functionality 
required for their APIs without the overhead of a larger framework. 
Additionally, Flask's extensive options of extensions and libraries, such as 
Flask-RESTful and Flask-SQLAlchemy, add to the development process for building 
scalable APIs and microservices.

Flask has built-in support for debugging and unit testing. Integrating unit 
testing and a debugger enables quick debugging and development. This debugging 
and testing support creates quick identification and resolution of issues 
during development.

Flask is trusted by large companies to build their applications. MIT, Reddit, 
Uber, Lyft, Zillow, Patreon, and Netflix are some examples of large 
corporations that use Flask. 

- An alternative to Flask:
Flask is simple, but powerful. Flask is unopinionated, meaning it doesn't 
enforce a specific project structure or dictate how you should organize your 
code. This flexibility allows developers to choose the tools and libraries that 
best suit their projects’ needs.

It is often compared to Django, which is considered a much more heavyweight 
framework. Django requires more setup to start building your app, whereas Flask 
requires very little. Django’s motto is batteries included, meaning everything 
you could possibly need is included. Flask takes a more selective approach, 
offering optional plugins to enhance functionality. Because of this, Django has 
a steeper learning curve. For more information on Django and how it compares to

It's important to note that Flask's simplicity and flexibility may require 
developers to make more decisions about project structure and components than 
would more opinionated frameworks. However, for developers who prefer to have 
more control over their applications’ architecture and components, Flask can be 
an excellent choice.

- Popular Flask plugins:
· Flask WTF: Create and process web forms
· Flask RESTful: Create REST API services
· Flask login:  Handles user authentication and identity
· Flask debug toolbar: Provides a handy browser toolbar to help you debug your 
Flask app

Flask has several useful plugins, so don’t reinvent the wheel. Leveraging 
Flask's extensive collection of plugins can significantly expedite development 
and enhance your application's functionality. These plugins cover a wide range 
of features, from authentication and form handling to database integration and 
caching, allowing you to tap into a large selection of pre-built solutions.

- Key takeaways:
Remember three key takeaways from this reading: 
· Flexibility and freedom: Flask's simplistic and minimalist design offers 
developers the freedom to select their preferred design patterns, databases, 
and plugins. This flexibility allows them to tailor their web applications 
according to their projects’ specific requirements.

· Rapid development and scalability: Flask’s support for WSGI templates 
enhances scalability and flexibility, making it suitable for building REST API 
servers and microservices. On the other hand, Django, with its comprehensive 
feature set, can be slower to set up initially, but may offer advantages in 
terms of built-in functionality for larger, more complex projects.

· Trust of large corporations: Flask is trusted by several large companies 
including MIT, Reddit, Uber, Lyft, Zillow, Patreon, and Netflix, to build their 
applications.
