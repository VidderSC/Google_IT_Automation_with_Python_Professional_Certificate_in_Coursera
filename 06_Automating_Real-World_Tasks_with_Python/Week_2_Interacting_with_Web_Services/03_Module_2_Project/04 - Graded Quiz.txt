This graded quiz assesses your understanding of the concepts and procedures 
covered in the lab you just completed. Please answer the questions based on the 
activities you performed in the lab.

Note:
You can refer to your completed lab for help with the quiz.
In order to complete this quiz, you must have completed the lab before it.

1. What is the primary benefit of processing text files into Python 
dictionaries before uploading data to a web service? 
  - Text files are too large to upload directly to web services.
  - Python dictionaries facilitate efficient data storage and retrieval.
X - Python dictionaries allow for easy data manipulation and transformation.
  - Text files cannot be processed by web services.

2. Why might you choose to use Python's JSON module over the 'pickle' module? 
  - Because JSON has a smaller memory footprint.
  - Because JSON supports more data types.
X - Because JSON is more secure.
  - Because JSON is faster.

3. Which of the following best defines a web framework in software development? 
  - A framework specifically designed for mobile application development.
  - A programming language used exclusively for web development.
X - A pre-built collection of tools, libraries, and best practices that 
    simplify the process of developing web applications.
  - A graphical user interface for designing website layouts and templates.

4. What is the primary purpose of Python's requests library? 
  - It is used for database interactions
  - It is used for scientific computing
  - It is used for creating GUI applications
X - It is used for handling HTTP requests

5. Which of the following is the required parameter for the os.listdir() method?
  - A list of file extensions
  - A file descriptor
X - A path to the directory whose contents you want to list
  - No required parameters

6. Which of the following statements best describes one of the constraints of 
REST architecture? 
  - REST APIs can maintain client sessions, allowing stateful interactions 
    between the client and server.
X - REST requires that the server does not store any client-specific session   
    information between requests, making it stateless.
  - REST allows clients to request a specific version of the API, ensuring 
    backward compatibility.
  - REST discourages the use of caching to minimize response time and improve 
    server performance.

7. What is the primary purpose of the HTTP POST method in web development? 
  - To request data from a server.
  - To retrieve data from a server cache.
  - To update existing data on a server.
X - To submit data to a server to create or update a resource.

8. Which of the following statements best describes an object-relational mapper 
(ORM) tool in the context of database programming? 
  - An ORM tool is used to translate data between incompatible type systems in 
    databases.
X - An ORM tool is used to map objects in object-oriented programming languages 
    to tables in relational databases, simplifying database interactions.
  - An ORM tool is used to create complex visualizations and graphs based on 
    database data.
  - An ORM tool is used to optimize database queries for better performance and 
    responsiveness.

9. Which of the following is a common use case for the cat command?
  - Executing code
X - Displaying a file’s contents
  - Compiling modules
  - Creating a new script

10. In the lab, why did you check the status_code after making a POST request?

  - To reveal the server’s IP address
  - To determine the size of the response
  - To display the content of the response
