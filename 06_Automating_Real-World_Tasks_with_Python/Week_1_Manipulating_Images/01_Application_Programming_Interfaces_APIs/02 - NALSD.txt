- NALSD:

Also known as "non-abstract large system design", is a discipline and a process 
invented by Google that aims to give SREs (site reliability engineers) the 
ability to assess, design, and evaluate large systems. NALSD is the process of 
designing complex and substantial systems, such as software applications, 
hardware systems, or even organizational structures, with a focus on practical, 
concrete details rather than on abstract or theoretical concepts. NALSD 
emphasizes the tangible and real-world aspects of system design and 
implementation. 

NALSD combines elements of capacity planning, component isolation, and graceful 
system degradation that are crucial to highly available production systems. 

- Key characteristics of NALSD:
NALSD requires DevOps teams to think about scale and resilience during the 
design process. It separates the design process into two phases. The two phases 
have the following key characteristics: 

- Phase 1: Technical design
Phase 1 is an iterative process that involves multiple rounds of design and 
refinement. It's common to create prototypes, conduct feasibility studies, and 
gather feedback from stakeholders to continuously refine the technical design. 
In this phase, the team tries to answer two questions about the proposed design:
· Is it possible? Will the design even work?
· Can we do better? Can we make it faster, simpler, or cheaper?

- Phase 2: Scaling up
In Phase 2, the team assesses whether the system design is feasible at scale. 
They consider how the system will perform when subjected to significant 
increases in load. Scalability is essential to ensure that the system can 
accommodate growth without a dramatic loss of performance. 
What if you suddenly add a million users to the system? How will the system be 
able to accommodate a random increase in users?

· Is it feasible? Will it work at scale? Is it cost-effective?
· Is it resilient? What happens if the database goes down? 
· Can we do better? Are there changes or additions that we need to make?

- Three key goals of NALSD:
· The first is proper capacity planning. Capacity planning is understanding how 
to properly size each component and how to properly plan for growth. This goal 
involves careful monitoring, performance analysis, and prediction of growth 
trends to prevent resource exhaustion or over-provisioning. Capacity planning 
is crucial in NALSD design because it involves estimating the required 
resources (CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth, etc.) to meet current and 
future demands.

· The second is component isolation. In NALSD design, a fundamental principle 
is component isolation, highlighting the importance of designing each element 
of the system to maximize simplicity, modularity, and independence from one 
another. The "do one thing and do it well" philosophy encourages developers to 
create components that have a clear and specific purpose.

· The final goal is graceful degradation. This is the idea that parts of the 
system should continue to work when another part fails, rather than everything 
failing at once. For example, in a web application, if a database server 
becomes unavailable, the system might switch to a read-only mode, allowing 
users to access existing data while blocking new updates until the database is 
restored.

- Google’s NALSD Workbook:
The NALSD Workbook was created by Google's SRE team. It is designed to help 
engineers and developers with the design and architecture of large-scale, 
reliable systems.

The NALSD Workbook contains valuable insights, best practices, and guidelines 
for designing and building complex and scalable systems that can handle high 
loads and remain reliable. Engineers often refer to such resources to improve 
their system design skills and create more robust and efficient software and 
infrastructure.

- Key takeaways:
Here are three key takeaways from this reading on NALSD:

· Definition of NALSD: NALSD, or Non-Abstract Large System Design, is a 
discipline and process introduced by Google, primarily aimed at empowering site 
reliability engineers (SREs) to assess, design, and evaluate large-scale 
systems. 

· Two phases of NALSD: Phase 1 involves continuous refinement through feedback, 
prototyping, and feasibility studies. It seeks to answer: "Is it possible?" and 
"Can we do better?" Phase 2 evaluates the system's feasibility and resilience 
at scale, considering how it will perform under significant load increases. 

· Three key goals of NALSD: Proper capacity planning, component isolation, and 
graceful degradation are the three goals of NALSD. These goals are in place so 
that the system can continue functioning even when individual parts fail.
