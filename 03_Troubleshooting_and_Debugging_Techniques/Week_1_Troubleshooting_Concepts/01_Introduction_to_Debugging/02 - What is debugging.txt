- Troubleshooting:
    · The process of identifying, analyzing and solving problems.
    · Troubleshooting is when we're fixing problems in the system running the 
      application.

- Debugging:
    · The process of identifying, analyzing and removing bugs in a system.
    · Debugging is when we're fixing the bugs in the actual code of the 
      application.

There are lots of tools that we can use to get more information about the 
system and what the programs in our system are doing.

Tools that can show us ongoing network connections, and help us analyze the 
traffic going over our cables:
· tcpdump
· Wireshark 

Tools that can show us the number and types of resources used in the system:
· ps 
· top
· free

To look at the system calls made by a program:
· strace 

To look at the library calls made by the software:
· ltrace

When debugging the code of a program, we can combine these tools with specific 
debugging tools developed for the programming language used to write the 
application.

Debuggers let us follow the code line by line, inspect changes in variable
assignments, interrupt the program when a specific condition is met and more.
